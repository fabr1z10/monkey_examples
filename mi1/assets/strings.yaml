1000: "So what brings you to\nMêlée Island™ anyway?"
1001: "Re-elect Governor Marley."
1002: "\"When there's only one candidate, there's only\none choice.\""
1003: "It doesn't seem to open."
1004: "That doesn't seem to work."
1005: "I can't move it."
1006: "I can't pick that up."
1007: "I don't see anything special about it."
1008: "I have ##settings.inventory['pieces_of_eight']## pieces of eight."
1100: "My name's Guybrush Threepwood. I'm new in town."
1101: "Are you a pirate? Can I be on your crew?"
1102: "Who's in charge here?"
1103: "Nice talking to you."
1104: "I don't know... I kind of like 'Guybrush.'"
1105: "Well, what's YOUR name?"
1106: "Yeah, it is pretty dumb, isn't it?"
1107: "I'm insulted. Goodbye."
1108: "I want to be a pirate!"
1109: "I've come seeking my fortune."
1110: "I really don't know."
1111: "None of your business. Goodbye."
1112: "Where can I find the governor?"
1113: "I want to talk to the leaders of the pirates."
1114: "Where can I find the Governor of the island?"
1115: "That's nice. Goodbye."
1116: "Why not?"
1117: "I'm welcome everywhere I go."
1118: "I think I'll go there right now. Bye."
1119: "How's that?"
1120: "Who is this pirate?"
1121: "That's too bad. Well, see you later."
1122: "Guybrush Threepwood?"
1123: "Ha ha ha!!!"
1124: "That's the stupidest name I've ever heard!"
1125: "But it's not even a name!"
1126: "Well, I am a pirate."
1127: "But alas, I'm not a captain."
1128: "You should go talk to the important-looking pirates in the next room."
1129: "They're pretty much in charge around here."
1130: "They can tell you where to go and what to do."
1131: "Governor Marley?"
1132: "Her mansion is on the other side of town."
1133: "But pirates aren't as welcome around her place as they used to be."
1134: "Well, the last time she had a pirate over for dinner, he fell in love with her."
1135: "It's made things rather uncomfortable for everybody."
1136: "Well, there's a whole big story about what happened next..."
1137: "But I don't believe a word of it."
1138: "Estevan over there at the other table might tell you about it."
1139: "He takes the whole thing seriously."
1140: "VERY seriously."
1141: "Have fun on Mêlée Island™."
1142: "Well, this island has a governor..."
1143: "...but we pirates have our own leaders."
1144: "Whatever you say."
1145: "Just watch out for those guard dogs!"
1146: "My name is Mancomb Seepgood."
1147: "Cozy."
1148: "I'd like to introduce myself... my name's Guybrush."
1149: "Excuse me, but I'm looking for the dart board."
1150: "Where can I get a drink?"
1151: "Sorry to bother you. Bye."
1152: "What are you looking at me for?"
1153: "Yeah, so what?"
1154: "What happened to your eye?"
1155: "Dart board?"
1156: "We don't have one anymore."
1157: "There was a horrible accident."
1158: "Drinking and darts don't mix."
1159: "A drink?"
1160: "You could wait for the cook to notice you..."
1161: "...but that could take all day."
1162: "Just find a mug and sneak into the kitchen."
1163: "That's what we all do."
1164: "Well, I was putting in my contact lens when--"
1165: "Hey, wait a second!"
1166: "That's none of your business!"
1167: "Right."
1168: "What now?"
1169: "Aye."
1170: "Aye, yourself."
1171: "Nice hat."
1172: "So, tell me about LOOM."
1173: "Nice talking to you."
1174: "They're busy listening to the guy on the left."
1175: "I don't want to bother them."
1176: "I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate."
1177: "I think they're busy."
1178: "I mean to kill you all!!!"
1179: "I want to be a pirate."
1180: "I want to be a fireman."
1181: "Get lost, boy, you bother us."
1182: "What be ye wantin', boy?"
1183: "So what?"
1184: "Why bother us?"
1185: "Hey, don't forget we're short on help because of this whole LeChuck thing."
1186: "So?"
1187: "So, no pirates means no swag, and no swag means no grog, and we're getting dangerously low on grog."
1188: "Hmm..."
1189: "Do you have any special skills?"
1190: "I can hold my breath for ten minutes!"
1191: "Well..."
1192: "All right, but you don't become a pirate just by ASKING."
1193: "You'll have to go through..."
1194: "The three trials!"
1195: "Er..."
1196: "What three trials are those?"
1197: "There are three trials every pirate must pass."
1198: "You must master the sword..."
1199: "...and the art of thievery..."
1200: "...and the quest."
1201: "The what?"
1202: "Treasure huntin', you sea urchin!"
1203: "Right."
1204: "You must prove yourself in each of these areas:"
1205: "swordplay, thievery, and, er, treasure huntery;"
1206: "then return with proof that you've done it."
1207: "And then ye must drink grog with us!!"
1208: "GROG!!!"
1209: "Tell me more about mastering the sword."
1210: "Tell me more about mastering the art of thievery."
1211: "Tell me more about treasure hunting."
1212: "You're a bunch of foul-smelling, grog-swilling pigs."
1213: "What's in that grog stuff, anyway?"
1214: "I'll just be running along now."
1215: "First, get ye a sword."
1216: "You must seek out and defeat the Sword Master."
1217: "Someone in town can probably direct you."
1218: "Oh..."
1219: "You'll want to find someone to train you first."
1220: "Ha ha."
1221: "Imagine trying to take on the Sword Master without any training!"
1222: "Har Har Har"
1223: "Tell me again about mastering the sword."
1224: "And get yourself trained first."
1225: "We want you to procure a small item for us..."
1226: "The Idol of Many Hands..."
1227: "...in the Governor's mansion!"
1228: "The Governor keeps the Idol o'Many Hands in a display case in the mansion outside of town."
1229: "You'll have to get past the guards, naturally."
1230: "The tricky part will be getting past the dogs outside."
1231: "They're a particularly vicious breed..."
1232: "...you might be able to drug them or something."
1233: "Tell me again about pilfering the idol."
